# Luxury Goods Smart Contract

The Luxury Goods smart contract is built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity language. This contract enables users to purchase luxury goods using STX or sBTC and receive NFTs as proof of purchase. The front end provides an interactive UI for browsing and buying luxury items.

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Payments**: Users can make payments using STX or sBTC, offering flexibility in payment methods and catering to different user preferences.
2. **NFT Minting**: Each user receives an NFT minted after every purchase, serving as a digital receipt and proof of ownership. These NFTs are unique and can be used to verify the authenticity of the purchased goods.
3. **Security Measures**: The smart contract incorporates robust security measures to ensure safe payments and secure NFT transfers. This includes encryption, validation checks, and secure wallet integrations.
4. **Interactive UI**: The front end, written in TypeScript, provides an engaging user experience where luxury goods are showcased. Users can connect their wallets using the Stacks.js module for seamless transactions.

## How It Works

1. **Browse Luxury Goods**: Users can explore the available luxury goods through the interactive UI. Each item is displayed with detailed information, images, and pricing.
2. **Make Payments**: Users can select their preferred payment method (STX or sBTC) and proceed with the payment for their selected items. The smart contract handles the payment processing securely.
3. **Receive NFT**: After a successful purchase, an NFT is automatically minted and sent to the user's wallet as proof of purchase. The NFT contains metadata about the purchase, including the item details and transaction information.
4. **Secure Transactions**: The smart contract ensures all transactions are secure, protecting both payments and NFT transfers. This includes multi-signature wallets and two-factor authentication where necessary.
